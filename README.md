Prototype notes:
- Scene flow:
    * For scene communications, we provided a simple example of how each scene will communicate with each other. In game.js, it has a better example on how we plan to handle scene communication, which is moving a block from different positions when swapping between scenes.

- Core gameplay:
    * For progression, it is mapped stage by stage in levels until you reach the end, but progression between scenes is dictated by a swapping mechanic in which players can do something in one scene that alters the level of the other scene allowing the player to progress through the levels and eventually move to the next stage.
